        <h1>Basic Logic Gates</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the first lesson on logic gates and circuits. This lesson will go over the basic elements of logic gates and how they are used in circuits. In this lesson we will cover:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What a logic gate is</li>
            <li>How logic gates are used</li>
            <li>Basic types of logic gates (AND, OR and NOT)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What is a logic gate?</h2>
        <p>
            Logic gates, also known as logic circuits, are the elements of a circuit that take binary input and produce binary output, depending upon the type of gate and the inputs recieved. As you can imagine this is extremely useful and logic gates form a fundamental part of modern computers. The complicated circuitry that allow computers to quickly perform arithmetic are built upon these relatively simple building blocks.
        </p>
        <h2>How are they used?</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, logic gates work by accepting binary output and outputting either a 1 or a 0 depending upon whether or not the inputs matched the conditions specified by the particular circuit they were being passed through.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Logic Gates</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we've covered the basics of what a logic gate is and how it works we can begin exploring the different types of logic gates and their functions.
            <h3>AND Gate</h3>
            The AND gate is one of the most simple but important gates. The AND gate takes two inputs and returns:
            <ul> 
                <li>1 if both inputs are true</li>
                <li>0 for all other cases</li>
            </ul>
            The AND gate is represented by this sign: <br> <img src='AND.png' alt='AND gate symbol' width='50%'>
            <h3>OR Gate</h3>
            The OR gate is yet another simple but important gate. The OR gate takes two inputs and returns:
            <ul> 
                <li>1 if either of the inputs are true</li>
                <li>0 if both inputs are false</li>
            </ul>
            The OR gate is represented by this sign: <br> <img src='OR.png' alt='OR gate symbol' width='50%'>
            <h3>NOT Gate</h3>
            The final gate is the NOT gate. This gate is different from the previous two in that it only takes one input and it inverts (or flips) the result. The values expected for any given inputs are below.
            <ul> 
                <li>1 if the input is 0</li>
                <li>0 if the input is 1</li>
            </ul>
            The NOT gate is represented by this sign: <br> <img src='NOT.png' alt='NOT gate symbol' width='50%'>
        </p>
        
        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
            Congratulations on getting through the first lesson! If you click the next button you'll be taken to a sandbox app that will allow you to play around with and develop your understanding of how these logic gates work. There are some other gates included but ignore those for now, they'll be covered in a later lesson.

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            This lesson has hopefully given you an understanding of some basic logic gates and how they work. Now that you have this information you should be able to build some more complex circuits. As such the challenge for this lesson is to build a circuit that operates in the same way as one of the circuits that will be covered in the next lesson. The circuit that you should attempt to build takes two inputs and returns a single output, the outputs it should return are:
            <ul>
                <li>1 if the first input is 0 and the second is 1</li>
                <li>1 if the first input is 1 and the second is 0</li>
                <li>0 if the first input is 1 and the second is 1</li>
                <li>0 if the first input is 0 and the second is 0</li>
            </ul>
            Here's a tip, building this circuit will require 2 AND gates, 1 OR gate and 1 NOT gate.

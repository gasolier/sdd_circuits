        <h1>More Logic Gates and Truth Tables</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the second lesson. This lesson will cover more complex logic gates and a method of checking the inputs and outputs of a circuit. In this lesson we will cover:

        <p>
            Continuing on from the previous lesson this lesson will deal with more complex logic gates, how they work and what they return.
            <h3>XOR Gate</h3>
            The name of this logic gate stands for eXclusive-OR gate. Similarly to the more simple OR gate the XOR gate takes two inputs and returns true if either provide the gate with a 1. However, unlike the OR gate which will output a 1 if both inputs are true simulataneously the XOR gate will only return positively if 1 is true and the other is false, this makes it an <i>exclusive</i> gate. Thus the XOR gate returns:
            <ul> 
                <li>1 if one input is true and the other is false</li>
                <li>0 if both inputs are false</li>
                <li>0 if both inputs are true</li>
            </ul>
            The XOR gate is represented by this sign: <br> <img src='XOR.png' alt='XOR gate symbol' width='50%'>
            <h3>NAND Gate</h3>
            A NAND gate is similar to an AND gate but at the end of the process you flip the output. This is identical to placing a NOT after the AND gate. For example if two 1's are passed into an AND gate it will pass out a 1 that when passed through a NOT results in a zero, this is exactly what the NAND gate returns. The results of the NAND gate are:
            <ul> 
                <li>0 if both inputs are true</li>
                <li>1 if one input is true and the other is false</li>
                <li>1 if both inputs are false</li>
            </ul>
            The NAND gate is represented by this sign: <br> <img src='NAND.png' alt='NAND gate symbol' width='50%'>
            <h3>NOR Gate</h3>
            Similarly to a NAND gate, a NOR gate is the inverted result of it's N-less form. For example if one 1 is passed through an OR gate it will return a 1 that when passed through an inverter returns a 0, this is the same result as passing a single 1 through a NOR gate. The results of the NOR gate are:
            <ul> 
                <li>0 if both inputs are true</li>
                <li>0 if one input is true and the other is false</li>
                <li>1 if both inputs are false</li>
            </ul>
            The NOR gate is represented by this sign: <br> <img src='NOR.png' alt='NOR gate symbol' width='50%'>

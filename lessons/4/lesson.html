        <h1>Speciality Circuits</h1>
        <p>
            As mentioned at the end of the previous lesson now that the fundamentals of circuit building have been established we can begin to work on developing our understanding of how simple circuits and logic can be used to build a more complex machine, such as a calculator or even a computer. Be forewarned, however, that this section assumes a basic knowledge of binary arithmetic.
        </p>

        <h2>Half-Adders</h2>
        <p>
        	An half-adder is a basic circuit, constructed from simple logic gates, that accepts two inputs and adds them together. As you will understand this is relatively simple, however unlike many of the other circuits we have looked at the half-adder produces two outputs, a sum and a carry. Taking this and our knowledge of binary addition into account we can see that an half-adder would be best represented by the truth table below:
        	<table>
        		<tr>
        			<th>A</th>
        			<th>B</th>
        			<th>Carry</th>
        			<th>Sum</th>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        		</tr>
        	</table><br>
            Actually building this circuit is also relatively simple. We only need two logic gates as, as we can see from the truth table, the circuit returns a carry of 1 only if both inputs are true and returns a sum of 1 only if only one input is true. The gates that match these specifications are, of course, the XOR and the AND gates. Thus the design of an half-adder is:

        </p>

        <h2>Full Adder</h2>
        <p>
            There is, however, a major issue with the half-adder. By itself it can only add two binary digits and this is unsuitable for constructing more circuits where multiple binary values are required to accurately represent integer or floating point values. If we wish to create a circuit that can add larger values then we need to extend the circuit in such a way that it is able to take into account the carry values from previous digit additions.
            <br>
            To do this we need to create a larger circuit from two half-adders, known as a full adder. The truth table for a full adder is:
            <table>
                <colgroup>
                    <col span='5' style='width: 200px'>
                </colgroup>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan='3'>Input</th>
                    <th colspan='2'>Output</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Carry In</td>
                    <td>A</td>
                    <td>B</td>

                    <td>Carry Out</td>
                    <td>Sum</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            As you can understand at this point the full adder becomes somewhat difficult to visualise but hopefully you can understand that it is simply adding three bits together. In practice constructing a full adder is just using two half-adders in succesion with another input for the carry in value. The full adder design also passes the carry output through an OR gate, resulting in a 1 if either half-adder has a carry of 1. Thus the design of a full adder is:
            <br>
            <img src='Full-adder.svg' style='width: 50%'>
            <br>
            Once you create a full adder adding larger binary digits becomes a simple matter of stringing the circuits together, with the carry out of each previous adder becoming the carry in of the next. Then the result of the addition is all of the sums and the final carry out. Thus the full adder is one of the most basic building blocks of a computer.
        </p>

        <h2>Flip-flops</h2>
        <p>
            Being able to add values is all well and good but unfortunately this is not worth much without the ability to store values in temporary and permanent memory. One method for storing data in temporary, or volatile, memory is the <i>flip-flop</i>. The flip-flop is a bistable circuit, which means that it is able to maintain one or two states at once. Due to this capability the flip-flop is the fundamental building block of volatile memory storage in a computer.
            <br>
            Most flip-flop designs break the circuit up into three separate components and we will examine each one of these components in some detail. These components are: the latch, the clock and the edge trigger.
        </p>

        <h3>The Latch</h3>
        <p>
            The first, and arguably most important, component is the latch. This is the part of the flip-flop that enables binary values to be stored and it achieves this through the use of <i>feedback</i>. Feedback refers to when output from further along the circuit is fed back into the circuit itself at an earlier point. You can likely see the value of this already, and it is this concept from which the latch is built. We will examine the RS-NAND latch which passes two inverted values - R and S, which stand for reset and set respectively - into two NAND gates, who's input is fed back into the other gate. This takes the form of:
            <br>
            <img src="latch.svg" style='width: 50%'>
            <br>
            And from this we can tell that passing some values into the loop, say S is 1 and R is 0, will form a loop due to feedback and will result in Q and <span style='border-top: 1px solid black'>Q</span> maintaining their state until a change occurs. We can extend this to form an entire truth table that describes the function of the RS-NAND latch.
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th><span style='border-top: 1px solid black'>S</span></th>
                    <th><span style='border-top: 1px solid black'>R</span></th>

                    <th>Q</th>
                    <th><span style='border-top: 1px solid black'>Q</span></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>Maintain State</td>
                    <td>Maintain State</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>Illegal</td>
                    <td>Illegal</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            The truth table, however, highlights a problem with the latch. If R and S are both equal to 1 then the operation is illegal and the latch will not work correctly. We will adress this after discussing the clock component.
        </p>

        <h3>The Clock</h3>
        <p>
            Another issue with the simple latch above is that if we have multiple latches then they can all change at different times. This can cause problems as we want our latches to be synchronised. Thus to solve this we introduce the clock component. The clock component is merely an extra input that changes from positive to negative at specific intervals. By passing R and S through a NAND gate that is attached to the clock we can ensure that the value stored in the latch only changes when the clock is 1. Therefore if multiple latches are connected to the same clock they will all change at the same time. Adding a clock component leads to the truth table becoming:
            <br>
            <table>
                <colgroup>
                    <col span='5' style='width: 200px'>
                </colgroup>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan='3'>Input</th>
                    <th colspan='2'>Output</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>S</td>
                    <td>R</td>
                    <td>Clock</td>

                    <td>Q</td>
                    <td>notQ</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>

                    <td>Illegal</td>
                    <td>Illegal</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            As you can see, whenever the value of the clock is 0 the latch maintains its previous state and when the clock is 1 we are free to modify the value within the latch. Unfortunately we still have the issue of illegal inputs. This is actually an extremely simple and yet elegant fix. If you examine the above table the only time that we change the value stored inside the latch is when S and R are the inverse of each other. Thus we can rather simply fix the issue of illegal inputs by only accepting a single bit of input and making the other input its inverse using a NOT gate. This is known as a D-type latch and it has the truth table:
            <br>
            <table>
                <colgroup>
                    <col span='5' style='width: 200px'>
                </colgroup>
                <tr>
                    <th colspan='2'>Input</th>
                    <th colspan='2'>Output</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Clock</td>
                    <td>D</td>

                    <td>Q</td>
                    <td>notQ</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    

                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                    <td>Maintain state</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                    

                    <td>0</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                    

                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>0</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            The D-type latch has the design: 
            <br>
            <img src="d-type.svg" style='width: 50%'>
        </p>

        <h3>The Edge Trigger</h3>
        <p>
            This is the component of the circuit that is intended to work with the clock in such a way so as to prevent the value of the latch changing mulitple times when the clock is set to 1. This helps to prevent issues with erroneous data caused by the values changing when they are not supposed to. The edge trigger does this by ensuring that the latch only changes once, when the clock changes from positive to negative. When the voltage of the clock changes it is known as an <i>edge</i>. This is much easier to understand as a visual:
            <br>
            <img src="edge-graph.gif" style='width: 50%'>
            <br>
            The above image demonstrates how voltage can rise and fall in a circuit, with the top lines representing a value of 1 and the bottom representing 0. The red and black circles represent where the voltage changes and thus highlight a positive and negative edge respectively. This allows us to understand what an edge trigger does, it allows the stored value to change only once, at a negative or positive edge depending upon the type of trigger used. 
            <br>
            Building an edge trigger is actually quite simple. To build this trigger we connect two D latches in sequence, the first it called a <i>master latch</i> and the second is called a <i>slave latch</i>. The latches use the same clocking component but the value is inverted before being passed into the slave latch. Furthermore the value of D for the slave latch is determined by the Q value of the master. What this means is that when the value of the clock is 1 then the value within the master latch can change as often as the D changes. However the second that the clock changes to 0 the value of the master latch can no longer change and the slave latch becomes mutable. At this point the final value of the master latch is passed into the slave latch and the value is immutable until the clock changes from positive to negative again. This may seem somewhat complex but is actually quite simple, the design of this is a complete flip flop and looks like this:

            <br>
            The above image introduces a new way of looking at circuit diagrams where labelled boxes are used to represent an entire section of circuitry. Don't worry about this too much, all it does is simplify the diagram and it is identical to having two D latches represented in sequence.

        <h2>Shift Registers</h2>
        <p>
            Being able to store single values is of course useful, but just like half adders and full adders it is more important to be able to store and operate on values that require significantly more bits. This is achieved using <i>shift registers</i>. All a shift register is, however, is a group of flip flops that are synchronised through the use of a common clock. Shift registers become significantly more complex than flip flops however in that there are many different varieties, all of which operate in significantly different ways. As a result we will only cover the serial in - serial out variation. 
            <br>
            This type of register is constructed from an arbitrary number of flip flops that are connected to the same clock and whose D value is determined by the previous flip flop's output. What this means is that if we want to store a value then values must pass through all the positions to their left before reaching their intended destination. The best way to understand this is through examples.
            <br>
            Let's imagine how we would store the value 1001 in a serial in - serial out shift register made up of four flip flops. These flip flops are labelled 4-1 in descending order from the left. This means that we want to store:
            <ul>
                <li> 1 in 4 </li>
                <li> 0 in 3 </li>
                <li> 0 in 2 </li>
                <li> 1 in 1 </li>
            </ul>
            As we want a 1 in the last flip flop the first value we need to pass into the register is a 1 as this will move all the way over to the final flip flop. After the 1 we need to pass two zeroes to fill 3 and 2 and finally we need to pass a 1 to fill 4. This is perhaps more easily visualised in table form:
            <br>
            <table>

                    <th colspan="2">Input</th>

            As you can see the values passed in move through each flip flop before reaching their final destination.  The circuit design of a serial in - serial out register is:
            <br>
            <img src="shift-register.svg" style='width: 50%'>
            <br>
            <i>Note: it is important to point out that most shift registers have another input that allows one to clear all the data stored in the register instantly, this is not shown in this diagram</i>
            <br>
            The advantage of this system is that it allows mutating the data by shifting it further along and this can simplify some arithmetic operations. The main disadvantage of this system is that data has to be written and read one bit at a time. The issue of writing can be solved by allowing data to be passed into each flip flop at the same time this is known as <i>parallel out</i> and the issue of reading can be solved by allowing data to be outputted at the same time rather than just through the final flip flops output, this is known as <i>parallel out</i>. The disadvantages of those systems is that the data is immutable and thus serial in - serial out registers are better utilised for processing and parallel in - parallel out are better utilised for the storage of data.

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we've covered speciality circuits we have covered all the specific technical knowledge as it relates to the hardware. The next lesson will focus on the steps that should be taken to understand and design any given circuit. After that we will cover boolean algebra and how to convert between the different methods of representing circuits. Now you'll go back into the sandbox, however you will not be able to construct flip flops as feedback is not supported in this program. You should, however be able to construct adders and this segues into your challenge.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            Your challenge for this section of work is to build a circuit that can add two four bit numbers. To do this you will first need to practise building half adders and full adders. After you feel that you have a solid grasp on this you should practice chaining full adders together. After this you should be able to construct a circuit that can accurately add two four bit numbers.

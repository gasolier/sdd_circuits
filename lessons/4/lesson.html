        <h1>Speciality Circuits</h1>
        <p>
            As mentioned at the end of the previous lesson now that the fundamentals of circuit building have been established we can begin to work on developing our understanding of how simple circuits and logic can be used to build a more complex machine, such as a calculator or even a computer. Be forewarned, however, that this section assumes a basic knowledge of binary arithmetic.

        <h2>Half-Adders</h2>
        <p>
        	A half-adder is a basic circuit, constructed from simple logic gates, that accepts two inputs and adds them together. As you will understand this is relatively simple, however unlike many of the other circuits we have looked at the half-adder produces two outputs, a sum and a carry. Taking this and our knowledge of binary addition into account we can see that a half-adder would be best represented by the truth table below:
        	<table>
        		<tr>
        			<th>A</th>
        			<th>B</th>
        			<th>Carry</th>
        			<th>Sum</th>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        		</tr>
        		<tr>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>1</td>
        			<td>0</td>
        		</tr>
        	</table>

        </p>

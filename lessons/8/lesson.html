        <h1>Circuit Design Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the final lesson on logic gates and circuits. This lesson will be going through the steps necessary for creating a circuit to solve arbitrary problems. The four steps involved in this are:
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the Inputs and Outputs</li>
                <li>Identify Necessary Components</li>
                <li>Check the Solution</li>
                <li>Evaluate the Design</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Identifying Inputs and Outputs</h2>
        <p>
            The first step that has to be taken is identifying the required inputs and outputs. This is a relatively simple step as all that we have to do is determine the number of inputs of a circuit, and potentially name them, and then do the same for the outputs. This is further simplified by the fact that many circuits only have a single output. An example of this would be the challenge that you faced in lesson 3. That problem had 3 inputs - the key, the door and the lights - and only had one output - the alarm.
        </p>

        <h2>Identify the Necessary Components</h2>
        <p>
            The second step we take is determining the required components that are required. The is a somewhat more difficult step as we have to determine and understand the relationship between the inputs and outputs before we can choose what logic gates we will require. Thus in this case it may be helpful to turn the problem into a number of easily parseable sentences or even convert it into boolean algebra, as this will allow you to convert the algebra directly into the related gates.
        </p>

        <h2>Check the Solution</h2>
        <p>
            The third step is to determine whether or not the circuit will work. There are many ways to do this, such as using a circuit simulator to build and check the circuit, however perhaps the most common and effective method of testing this is by using truth tables. To do this you just lay out the inputs and outputs as you would in a regular truth table and then you follow the circuit with all the input permutations. If the output is not what you expected you must go back and redesign the circuit.
        </p>

        <h2>Evaluate the Design</h2>
        <p>
            Once the circuit has been completed and it works you are free to evaluate the design. This step is the final step and is also just a matter of considering the circuit and experimenting to test whether or not there is a simpler and easier way to achieve the same result. If you haven't already done this than a possible way to do this could involve writing the circuit down as a boolean algebra expression and then simplifying it. This step, however, is largely a matter of experience and it requires a lot of time to build the skills necessary to create efficient circuits.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
            Well done! You just completed the final lesson on circuits and logic gates, you made it! Now that you've completed all the lessons you are free to go to the next stage, which is a small quiz to test whether or not you were paying attention. After this, well, there's nothing else planned although you are free to come back at any time to brush up on your knowledge or play with the simulator.
